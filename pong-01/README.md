# Pong - The State Machine Update
I'm going to redo this one formally with the State pattern introduced later on in the course.  I'm going to do my best to leave optimatizations out so I can keep the code as close to the original as possible.

So, after finishing this I seriously underestimated the amount of time it would take to convert everything to the State Machine.
